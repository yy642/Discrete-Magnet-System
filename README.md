# Discrete-Magnet-System
This project provides methods to 
(1) compute the force and energy between two magnetic arrays with {-1,1} representing the magnetic dipole orientations.
(2) Using backtrack/DFS to enumerate all possible interactions between two magnetic arrays.
(2) Given the target force, or energy, compute the configuration of magnetic arrays.
(3) Using NN in keras/Tensorflow to model both foward and inverse problem


utils.py: includes the general computation methods
inverse_solver.py: given target force, or energy, compute the configuration of magnetic arrays
